> Q1. Why some region can not visit Youtube or other video websites? 

Playing video and downloading resources will produce a lot of trafficï¼Œ it will slow down the network speed of other users at the same region, it is not fair to others. If you really need it, don't worry. We also provide some Video dedicated VPN region (You will find them at the second VPN region group).
